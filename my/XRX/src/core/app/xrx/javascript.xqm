This is a component file of the VdU Software for a Virtual Research Environment for the handling of Medieval charters.

As the source code is available here, it is somewhere between an alpha- and a beta-release, may be changed without any consideration of backward compatibility of other parts of the system, therefore, without any notice.

We expect VdU/VRET to be distributed in the future with a license more lenient towards the inclusion of components into other systems, once it leaves the active development stage.
